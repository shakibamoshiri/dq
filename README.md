Debug docker quickly using **D**ocker **Q**uery

Debugging one container using `docker inspect` is okay if we are running just one.  
But debugging many of them with different networks, names, ports, etc can be cumbersome.  
**dq** is a simple CLI to query API, extract some information and show it for all containers.
